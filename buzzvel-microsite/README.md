# buzzvel-microsite

My repository for the Buzzvel test.

## First

This repository contains the source code for a Next.js application built for a buzzvel test. It uses Next.js, React, React DOM, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS to create a modern and performant web application or website. The project is well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns between static assets and source code.

The main components of the application are located in the `app` directory, including `layout.js` and `page.js`. The `data` directory holds JavaScript files containing professional experience data and information about why Buzzvel. The `helpers` directory contains a utility file (`utilities.js`) that likely contains reusable functions or helper methods. The `hooks` directory contains a custom hook file (`useViewSize.js`) that contains a custom React hook for managing view size and detect mobile devices.

The project's structure is well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns between static assets and source code. The use of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and other modern web development technologies indicates that the project is likely a modern, performant web application or website. The presence of custom hooks and utility functions suggests that the project employs a modular and reusable codebase.

To start the development server, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.

For more information about Next.js, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn)

To deploy your Next.js app, you can use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
